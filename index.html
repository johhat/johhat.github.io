    <h2>current projects</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Project leader and co-founder, Ascend NTNU.</strong> Ascend NTNU is a new aerial robotics team, created to represent The Norwegian University of Science and Technology in the International Aerial Robotics Competition. This competition was made to forward the state of autonmus aerial robotics, and their missions represent challenges that currenly are impossible for any flying robot owned by government or industry. When we started the project in the summer of 2015, it was very well recieved by our faculty at the university. They gave us our very own lab, and other resources to get us started. We are now 14 persons cooperating with both the university and Norwegian industy to solve the current mission.

      <strong>Consultant, Beerenberg HR.</strong> Beerenberg is an industrial company with 1500 employees located in Bergen. My current work for their human resources departement is related to capacity utilization, cost calculations and development of platforms to facilitate efficient communication between the departement and the other branches of the organization. I do a lot of heavy analytic work for them, where the tasks typically involve aggregation of huge amounts of data. In turn, the findings and models I make help them take good decisions. I have worked for them in various roles since 2009, and I usually spend my entire summer at their office.

      <strong>Bass player and co-founder, The New Wine.</strong> The New Wine is a four-person band playing our own electro-inspired music in a live format. While we are laying low at the moment, we have done a lot of stuff in the past. In Norway we have played festivas such as Øya, Hove and Vinjerock. We have toured a lot in Europe, our longest trip being a one month support-tour with The Whitest Boy Alive. Shortly after the release of our debut album Waves, we went to Japan in 2011 and did a few concerts there. A visit which suddendly became a bit more dramatic than planned, as we still were in Japan when the massive 2011 earthquake struck the country.
